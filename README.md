# University-Project-Management-SDLC

Foundations of SDLC, Agile, and Project Management.

Several units I undertook at university that focused on software or application development, 
taught the processes and methodologies of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), 
Agile and Waterfall approaches, and sprints and scrums.

The ICT Project Management unit was another hands-on learning experience, 
developing a simple case study and project planning artefacts.

Technologies used range from MS Visio, Project, Word, PowerPoint, Teams, Taiga io, to Creately and Photoshop.
